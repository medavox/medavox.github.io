			<p>How is it that all the innocence can be sucked out of a room in a single text,<br />
how can i plummet so far from a place so high, and yet not die from the dizzying vertigo?</p>
<p>There was once a version of me who could raise an arm in action,<br />
who could make some attempt, feeble or not, to prevent his own demise<br />
(or even merely his slump into the turgid entropy of apathy and compliance),<br />
but not now. He is gone.</p>
<p>I traded in the very poetry i so feebly mimic now,<br />
for the gain in proactivity which has recently deserted me.<br />
I am small and unimportant, and no matter what i do to try and forget that,<br />
I cannot stop that fact overuling my life, and willigness to live it.</p>
<p>All feeling deserts me, all friends abandon me,<br />
or I them.<br />
All meaning crumbles away, silently forgotten and forever lost.<br />
Does anyone remember MySpace?</p>
<p>Every mountain I am proud of climbing pales in comparison to the one visible from its summit,<br />
All my energy is spent standing still while others run past me, my former peers and fellow-passengers, no longer aware of me, until I have no more energy left, and i regress back to some pathetic and helpless man-child.<br />
I wonder if I am alone in my slopping, grinding self-imposed rut, and am neither sure whether I am comforted or horrified if I weren't.<br />
The embarassment of my accomplishments bears down on me like an imaginary crowd of judging colleagues, now long gone.</p>
<p>Why is it that it's only when i feel like this, that I become overwhelmingly sentimental for a magical past that never really existed?</p>
<p>From past experience of being myself, I know that I get like this, and I also know that none of the times I am fantasising back to were really that much good;<br />
I know this as a fact, but I can't help feeling that it was all so much better before (before when?), and want to wrap myself up in the warm, cuddly, edited blanket of the past.<br />
Where every other day my (now ex) best friends are round, it's summer, and I only stop laughing or talking about culture to breathe or eat. It never really happened. Or did it?</p>
