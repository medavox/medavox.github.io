							<h1>Adam's Low-Cost Milk Substitute</h1>

			<div class="content">
			<p>If you need a milk-like fluid (sounds appealing, eh?) in an emergency, this'll sort you out.</p>
<p>Technically this is a kind of gruel, but it has milk-like properties.</p>
<p>Although the ingredients won't change, I'll be tweaking the quantities to get the most appealing consistency.</p>
<h2 id="intended-uses">Intended Uses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pouring it on your cereal</li>
<li>A nourishing, stand-alone drink</li>
<li>UNTESTED: putting it in your tea or coffee</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uses-not-intended-for">Uses NOT Intended For</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use in cookery, eg scrambled eggs</li>
<li>as a replacement for breastmilk</li>
<li>feeding to nut-allergic people you hate</li>
<li>feeding to gluten-intolerant people you hate</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>made from cheap and easily available household foods</li>
<li>Not labour-intensive</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="downsides">Downsides</h2>
<ul>
<li>For all the wishing in the world, it's NOT milk. So nutritionally, it WILL be different. I would bet there's no calcium in it, for one thing.</li>
<li>The consistency can easily become gloopy, which is unappealing. Possibly add more water to fix this.</li>
<li>It can also separate slightly after standing. Just give it a stir; this even happens to soya milk.</li>
<li>It won't LOOK that much like milk, probably due to complicated food chemistry reasons, like the albedo of animal proteins and fats in organic suspension vs plant subsitutes (or something. I don't know. I just ad-libbed that. Sounds like an hilarious scientific paper though).</li>
<li>It takes a while to make: boiling the starch out of the rice</li>
<li>It takes a lot of energy (heat/electricity) to boil the rice</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a decent milk alternative, your basically needs to contain 2 things: fats, and a dissolvable starch. AKA carbohydrate.</p>
<p>I've tested oats, rice and peanut butter in various combinations and, considering the more expensive this recipe gets the less point it has, these 2 ingredients seem to provide the best trade-off between price and quality.</p>
<p>The peanut butter provides the fats, protein and some salt, and the rice provides sugars and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>You can try any edible fat and starch source (so no candle wax, earwax or petroleum jelly please).<br />
I found that adding the solid part of coconut milk (I had it lying around at the time) produced a creamier, yummy result. And whitened the mixture slightly, which helps with presentation.</p>
<h2 id="ingredientsyou-will-need">Ingredients/You Will Need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 Litre of water</li>
<li>20g of rice
<ul>
<li>can be really cheap, with broken grains, it doesn't matter. Cheap rice is starchy rice, which is what we want</li>
</ul></li>
<li>~2 teaspoons of peanut butter
<ul>
<li>Smooth or crunchy is fine. I've tried both, and the only difference I've found is the amount of bits you get when filtering later</li>
<li>Again, cheaper may be better for this, as its natural nut oils have been stabilised less with additives, so are more readily available for mixing into the milk.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A grinding tool, such as one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Blender</li>
<li>Pestle and mortar</li>
<li>Rolling pin and saucepan (the ghetto pestle and mortar :)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Heat source, which can bring 1 litre of water to boil
<ul>
<li>use your imagination :)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Using the grinding tool, grind up the dry rice as much as you can. This increases its surface area, making it give off its starch more easily.</li>
<li>Add the ground rice, peanut butter and water to a pan of water, and boil like the dickens for about 2 hours. The mixture should have turned a translucent beige, the peanut butter disappeared (except for the chunks if you're using crunchy peanut butter) and the rice turned into a gloopy porridge (congee).</li>
<li>Take off the heat, pour into a storage container (such as a large jug) and leave to cool.</li>
<li>Once cool, refrigerate and (like all milk-like liquids) use within about 3 days.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next I plan to try making yoghurt with this stuff. Wish me luck!</p>
