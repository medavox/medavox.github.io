Em                      D
Foolish machine didn&#39;t know I could dream

        C                           B
was it a nightmare or an error in the drive?

Em                                  D
something feels wrong like there&#39;s been a mistake

    C                               B
I&#39;m awake but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m alive

    F                       Am
My brain is infected with 4 prime directives

    Em                  Bm
I&#39;m quite a remarkable tool

    A#                  Dm
But somehow I feel like I used to be someone

    Am                                  Bm
who thought about about more than these rules

(No Capo)
Bm
Murphy it&#39;s you
F#m
Murphy it&#39;s you
            G                                   A/G
I watched it happen they killed you, you were dead
                G                               A/G
they blew your arm off and they shot you in the head

Bm
Murphy it&#39;s you
F#m
what did they do?
                G                           A/G
though I don&#39;t know if you rememember who i am
            G                           F#
I was your partner for a day my name is Anne

B               B/A#
Murphy it&#39;s you
G#m             G#m/F#
Murphy it&#39;s you
            E                               F#/E
you act so calm but I can see that you&#39;re in pain
            E                               F#/E
you run a program but you used to have a name
        B           B/A#        G#m
it was Boddicker, look up the case
B/A#        G#m         G#m/G
all of it&#39;s true
        B               B/A#        G#m
take the screws out and look at your face,
F#          B
Murphy it&#39;s you

(Capo on 4)
Em                  D                   C                   B
Why am I able to conjure feelings my programming shouldn&#39;t allow?
Em                      D                   
Frustrating glimpes of people who loved me
    C                           B
but what would they think of me now?

F                           Am
Strange little tics from the life i once knew
        Em                      Bm
like the way that i holster my gun
A#                      Dm
Why can i punch through a wall and not feel it
    Am                      Bm
but don&#39;t know that I had a son?

Cm
[Murphy it&#39;s you]
Etched in my head all the looks on their faces

Gm
[Murphy it&#39;s you]
the pleasure they took from my pain


[before they can&#39;t accept devices on the chrome/crime]
taunting and teasing and making bad jokes 

[you had a son you had wife you had a home]
just as if they were playing a game

[Murphy it&#39;s you]
how many corpses are given the chance to 

[What did they do?]
avenge themselves after they&#39;re lost

[Are you zombie or a robot or a man?]
Wait till I finally find them and force them to pay for the life that they cost
[Can you inmorpht or is your head an empty can?]/
[Can you remorter is your head in a tin can?]

[Murphy it&#39;s you]
I have to go now

[Murphy it&#39;s you]
I must not linger

[no one told me but I know it when I saw]
I will find these killers
[It&#39;s in your step it&#39;s in your voice it&#39;s in your jaw]
I&#39;ll use my finger

[So you better believe what I said]
So I better believe what she said
BOTH: all of it&#39;s true

BOTH: OCP brought me [you] back from the dead

MURPHY IT&#39;S YOU
MURPHY IT&#39;S YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU</code></pre>
