			<p>no transporters - they just make no sense.<br />
site-to-site replication might exist, beaming the things energy and 'blueprint',<br />
but this could easily act as a weapon, given the energy content of matter</p>
<p>gay people exist</p>
<p>no holodeck - however a matrix-like neural simulator exists, but is controversial<br />
tactile button-based controls for priority posts<br />
replicators exist, but require supplies of raw materials<br />
many people prefer to cook their own food, replicating the ingredients instead<br />
the UFP's success is due to fusing the pursuit of scientific knowledge with compassion for fellow people<br />
due to logistical constraints, starships are usually single-species environments, so that their atmospheres, temperatures, humidities,<br />
aromas etc can be tailored to the comfort of their crew<br />
forcefields are limited, and have not replaced airlocks<br />
orbital mechanics are respected, as are the newtonian laws of motion<br />
planetary exploration is carried out by specially-trained away-teams (rather than bridge crew),<br />
launched in drop-ships</p>
<p>warp drive exists because it has to, for the star trek universe to work at all<br />
it's a riff on the alcubierre drive theory<br />
the UFP operates as an 'Asynchronous Society': because of the time dilation effects of warp drive,<br />
solar systems are isolated pockets of local time.<br />
Going on a far intersolar mission means 50 or more years will have passed back home<br />
this is why starship crew bring their family along!</p>
<p>Artifical life has been banned, after a war for survival which nearly wiped out all biological life<br />
computers and large computing machines are allowed, but neural nets are forbidden,<br />
and small electronics are allowed on a case-by-case basis<br />
along with this, electronic body modification is an extreme taboo(maybe?)</p>
<p>articial gravity exists as a passive technology: that is, it works even when unpowered.</p>
<p>there are crazy, enterprise-like starship designs, and then there are those suitable for atmospheric travel.</p>
<h2 id="key-technological-advances">Key technological advances:</h2>
<p>manipulation of gravity<br />
highly efficient reaction drives (needing far less fuel than anything today)<br />
warp drive (an extension of the gravitational technology)</p>
