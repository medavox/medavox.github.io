<p>Here's an idea I had.</p>
<h2 id="problem-outline">Problem Outline</h2>
<p>Dropbox is an incredibly useful piece of software for keeping files synced across multiple machines; but by using their service, Dropbox can stake a claim to your data.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have no idea what they're doing with it</li>
<li>You can't be sure they've really deleted something (hint: they haven't)</li>
<li>If you made a commercially interesting piece of software (something that could make money), what would happen to your rights to the IP?</li>
<li>The maximum file and storage sizes are (understandably, considering they personally store copies of everything you sync) very low, and this restricts its usefulness.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think about a normal use case (updating a few files at a time between devices, or friends), you don't REALLY need a centralised server to keep copies of everything. It's expensive to have that storage space, keeping it running and connected to the internet all the time.</p>
<p>Plus, as I said with Dropbox specifically, it encumbers your files with possible ownership and legal controversy. Best to avoid that can of worms.</p>
<p>Distribox shall be a decentralised method for syncing files between computers, but without anyone but you having copies.</p>
<p>The only people who have your files are people on your peer-access list</p>
<p>It shall use existing technology to provide this:-</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html">Bit-torrent</a>: good at reducing bandwidth costs of a one-to-many download, by trading pieces of files among peers. Means the original syncing file only needs to be uploaded once by the originator, (like Dropbox, to its central servers).</li>
<li><a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>: robust file-transfer application, which uses differential transfer: only transfers new files, (or even parts of files, I think?) that have changed. Would save a lot of bandwidth.</li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>: an existing solution for peers to exchange versions of files; I don't THINK I want version history in this program, but it could be added as an optional feature later.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cryptography.org/getpgp.htm">PGP</a>: inevitably, some kind of encryption will be needed to prevent unauthorised peers from getting copies of your files. An authentication system would be good, possibly along with encrypted packet transmission, and/or encrypted storage. <a href="http://www.cryptography.org/getpgp.htm">Pretty Good Privacy</a> is a good candidate for any of these. Depending on how paranoid the user is, or I am.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is some functionality overlap with Git itself, but here are reason why I believe this software needs writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git is not visible to end-users: its intended audience are developers, and its steep learning curve (tens of commands to learn each with its own single-character options; a new mental model for manipulating 'staged' files which are 'indexed') would prevent its adoption by non-programmer power users</li>
<li>Existing GUIs for git are unfinished, non-free, buggy o r as confusing as the commandline interface, with none of the portability.</li>
<li>Git is much more complex than is necessary for this task</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="external-interface">External Interface</h2>
<p>Users will choose:-</p>
<ul>
<li>a folder they wish to keep synced,</li>
<li>and ONE UNIFIED list of peers that sync to this folder.</li>
<li>a maximum size limit of data to sync (optionally no limit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Theoretically users could choose different peer lists for different folders, but this could get complex for the user (and possibly for implementation) very quickly, so I will probably only let users sync 1 folder to 1 list of peers for now.</p>
<p>This will work best for one person editing at a time (avoiding merge conflicts), but can be adapted (again with existing technology) to work with more.</p>
<h2 id="platform-support">Platform Support</h2>
<p>I intend to write this for Windows, Linux and Android, which will affect library choices slightly. I won't implement this for an Apple product and, despite this being open-source, I'll take measures to make sure no-one else does. For an idea why, read <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18377_5-reasons-you-should-be-scared-apple.html">this article</a>. Or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.">this one</a>. Or <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/181200/apple_marketing_locks_you_in.html">this one</a>.</p>
<p>The backend can probably be written once (pending disk and network IO libraries); just the external UI will need separate versions for each platform.</p>
<h2 id="the-act-of-syncing-a-file">The Act of syncing a file</h2>
<p>At the start, peers will have to get all the files from a filled folder;<br />
later, peers will have to receive updates.<br />
A peer with new files will announce updates to all peers (push?)<br />
peers can download a difference patch, or the whole file if it's new</p>
